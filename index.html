                <p><span class="indent"></span>I was born and raised in California's Central Valley and, being that close to Silicon Valley, I think it instilled in me a love of technology and business. That's why, when I started college at CSU Stanislaus, I studied Business Marketing and began teaching myself web development.</p>

                <p><span class="indent"></span>After graduating I got a job as a sales rep for a few different furniture companies. During this time I realized that there were many furniture stores that lacked a web presence. Seeing an opportunity there, I started my own web development company. It was a pretty simple model; just make simple sites for the customers I was already working with. But it showed me a world of possibilites.</p>

                <p><span class="indent"></span>I saw a future in web development and I knew, in order to progress more quickly, I needed better training. That's when I enrolled at Epicodus, a vocational school for web developers in Portland, OR, focusing on Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. Despite the occasional 70 hour week, I loved my time at Epicodus, and my skills as a developer grew exponentially.</p>

              </div>
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <p><span class="indent"></span>After Epicodus, I came back to California and resumed took a role with Homelegance Furniture where I did outside sales and created web applications to help the company grow. This included a <a href="https://homelegance-kiosk.com/?user=1" target="_blank">catalog kiosk application</a> (featured above) and a sales analysis tool (demo coming soon).</p>

                <p><span class="indent"></span>I am currently getting my MBA at Boston College (class of 2020) with an emphasis in Data Analytics and hope to go into product management, data analysis, or technology consulting in the technology or video game industry. </p>
                <p><span class="indent"></span>When I'm not programming I am doing a ton of other things. Top hobbies include reading at hipster-looking coffee shops, playing video games, lifting heavy things, and playing music. I'm deeply passionate about politics, economics, technology, and data.</p>
